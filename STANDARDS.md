# Standards
> If you're using LWPCMS, you should follow these standars/recommendations:
> * Just because you are allowed to edit the source code does not mean you
should (unless you are contributing). If there is an LWPCMS update, it will
probably break your site if you have edited the source code.
> * Instead of editing the source code, create a module/plugin for your needs.
