> LWPCMS is a web content management system written in python.
> Most people would probably compare it with Wordpress.

> LWPCMS is currently in the alpha stage, work-in-progress.
> Since LWPCMS is in the alpha stage, there is no reason to use this project
> professionally at this point.

> ##### LWPCMS will bring you:
> * Management of content.
> * File/Attachment uploading.
> * User management.
> * Website traffic analytics.
> * Module/Plugins. (plugins are called modules in LWPCMS, since they are
100% structured like python module/packages.)
> * Hooks. ([See available hooks](lwpcms/api/constants.py))
> * Themes.
> * Full access to source code.
>
> Some of these stuff are not implemented yet, please see "issues".<br>
> And of course, there is more to come...

> ##### NOTE
